  <h1>Dilapidated Negative Emotion Factory</h1>

  
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Hello</h2>
    <p>
      Many greetings fellow adventurer! What is this place you ask? 
      It was once heaven on earth, but now it is a desolate land.
      Well, it is a truly sorrowful tale. 
      Have your tissues? Ok, but don't say I didn't warn you...
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Exceptional Times</h2>
    <p>
      A long time ago, this was a flourishing land. 
      Kids from all over would come to this blissfull place. 
      The nearby mountains had not snow, but candy snowing(candying?) down upon them every day. 
      They would play in the waves of chocolate sauce and explore the little islands made of brownies.
      They would come home to this whery spot,
      Here, grandest building once stood, with a glass dome and graceful arches the Hacko.
      But there was one person who could not <strong><em>stand</em></strong> to see all this happiness.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Lonely Loser</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Hacker</strong> was a mean old woman. 
      She lived in a little house on the beach made of a disgusting substance from a far away land. 
      It had stiff walls made of a substance the color of mold and a roof of unruly bushes that was directly proportional to the huge amount of comments in her code.
      She called this revolting creation <em>broccoli</em>. 
      The kids of course were much more interested in modern projects, like game development. 
      However, they made an unforgivable mistake...<strong>they didn't add comments</strong>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Lawless Revenge</h2>
    <p>
      Hearing that her sacred system had been violated such, the Hacker set out for revenge..
      She came up with a punishment so heinous that I loath to say it: <strong>Homework</strong>.
      Kids no longer had enough time to create all their amazing projects, but even they understood that programming was non-negotiable.
      The Hacker, seeing that her punishment was not harsh enough, decided to destroy the very thing these children enjoyed.
      She injected a concept into game development that would cause PTSD in kids for centuries to come.
      I cannot even say what it was for fear of getting hunted down by her, but try looking at the start of each section.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h2>One Last Hope</h2>
    <p>
      Seas of chocolate turned salty, the mountains of candy became angry and the kids became depressed.
      The Hacker had taken the one thing they loved away! Slowly, the land became desolate, with only the rare soul left with the Hacker.
      The kids grew old without wonder and became mindless minions of corporations.
      The Hacker grew lonely, realising the children brought a sense of liveliness to the community.
      One night, she sacrificed her sleep to draft a treaty: <strong><em>The Hacker's Code</em></strong>.
      She promised that if children were to accept and follow this Code, she would introduce wonderful things to the world of game developement, and never 
      stop children from exploring again. Will you help us reach a better future?
